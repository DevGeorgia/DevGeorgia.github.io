<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<article>
    <p>I don't want to copy my resume or linkedin profile because let's be honest it tells nothing about me. I prefer to present this like small facts, maybe fun facts.</p>
    <div>
        <p class="about">
            Why this nickname ?
        </p>
        <p class="fact">
            Georgia was the name of one character I played in a role play game. I played this character so many months, Georgia became my second first name.<br/>
            I will keep secret the "LR" suffix chosen by my mates.

            Why this avatar ?
        </p>
        <p class="fact">
            I have an hidden country soul. I like the style cowboy hat, lumberjack shirt and santiags (I'd love to have some boots with spurs just to make some "gling gling" sound when I walk). <br/>
            To be more precise, my avatar is a human version of Applejack in "My Little Pony"
