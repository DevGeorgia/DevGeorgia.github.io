        <p>This github page is my portfolio. I built it with jekyll and bootstrap.</p>
        <p>I decided to create this portfolio because most of my experience as a developer is self learning or personal projects. I'm curious and I like discovering new technologies, so I really wanted to show that you can't define people by their unique profesional experience.</p>
