### Project

It was a part of my traineeship project. The company wanted a SVG library to replace their canvas library. The technical specification was only JS and jQuery, no external libraries. During this traineeship I really felt like I was re-coding some Paint application (I hate geometry so hard).

The business needs was to be able to draw some shapes on documents and attached them to notes in an approval process.

You just have the front-part here, sorry if the visual is ugly they already had a front-end application, my job was just to provide them a library for the application.

Technologies : html, javaScript, jQuery, svg (for information, the back end was made with PHP / CodeIgniter and MongoDB)
